## Controls

### Client Controls (Touch/Click Interface):
| Zone                                   | Action                   | Sync Behavior |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Left Edge (≤ 87px)**                 | ⏪ Rewind 5 seconds       | ✅ Synced      |
| **Right Edge (≥ screen width − 87px)** | ⏩ Skip forward 5 seconds | ✅ Synced      |
| **Center (±75px from center)**         | ▶️ Toggle Play / Pause   | ✅ Synced      |
| **Between Left Edge and Center**       | 🔉 Decrease volume (5%)  | ❌ Local only  |
| **Between Center and Right Edge**      | 🔊 Increase volume (5%)  | ❌ Local only  |

There are also 2 chat commands called /fullscreen and /rename, they work as the name implies

> Of course use Left Click if you're not in minecraft while using this

### Admin Controls (Web Interface):
- Playlist creation and management
- Remote play/pause/skip/seek controls to eliminate desync
- Main video selection with custom start time
- File browser for media management
- FFmpeg generated thumbnail for video from the first third of the video
- Tab to use various ffmpeg tools

## Firewall Warning

By default, the `console.ps1` script will automatically:
1.  Check if a Windows Firewall rule exists for your configured `PORT` (default 3000).
2.  If missing, it will restart the script as Administrator to add the rule.

To **disable** this behavior (e.g., if you manage firewall rules manually), add the following to your `config.env`:

```properties
SYNC_SKIP_FIREWALL_CHECK=true
```

join_mode: sync/reset         # Decides what happens when a new user joins the watch party (more info in actual config)
HTTPS: t/f                    # Whether you want to use https or not, but you also need cert and key files(check /cert)
bsl_s2_mode: any/all          # Changing requirements of BSL-S² to if all clients should have file or not
video_autoplay: t/f           # Explains itself
admin_fingerprint_lock: t/f   # Generates a fingerprint from to first machine to access /admin to not let others reach it (t/f)

chat_enabled: t/f             # Yeah
data_hydration: t/f           # When enabled, the server injects initial data into admin.html to save a round-trip, improves overall performance
max_volume: [100-1000]        # How much should clients be able to crank the volume up to
subtitle_renderer: wsr/jassub # Which subtitle renderer should be used to render .ass subtitles, wsr is generally more compatible than jassub
