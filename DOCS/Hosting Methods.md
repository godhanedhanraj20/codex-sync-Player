Method 1: Tailscale (Virtual LAN)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Beware, Tailscale only allows 3 emails per [Tailnet](https://tailscale.com/kb/1136/tailnet), but it allows a 100 devices to be connected at the same time, so it would be best if you created a new email for your friends to log into tailscale to just for this

> Basic to setup. *Safest way to do it as in cybersecurity.* Takes a bit longer than method one to do a subsequent start. Also gives trusted SSLs for HTTPS

1. Download and install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) on everybody's computers
2. Invite your friends to your [Tailnet](https://tailscale.com/kb/1136/tailnet)
